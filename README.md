# Unemployment Data Analysis and Prediction

# Introduction
This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter notebook that walks through the analysis and prediction of unemployment data in India. The dataset used in this analysis includes information on unemployment rates, employment, and labor participation rates across different regions and time periods.

# Contents
1. Import Libraries:
Essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are imported to facilitate data manipulation and visualization.
2. Load Unemployment Data:
The provided unemployment dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
3. Explore and Clean Data:
Basic information about the dataset is displayed, including data types and missing values.
The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, and the updated information is presented.
4. Data Visualization:
The unemployment rate trends over time are visualized using a line plot, showcasing variations across different regions.
5. Statistical Analysis:
Summary statistics of the unemployment rate, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, are computed.
The correlation matrix is visualized to explore relationships between different variables.
6. Impact of COVID-19:
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the unemployment rate is visualized using a bar plot.
7. Predictive Modeling:

Linear Regression:
Linear regression is applied to forecast future unemployment rates, and the model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error.

Random Forest Regression
Random Forest regression is employed for unemployment rate prediction, and the model's accuracy is assessed.

Decision Tree
A Decision Tree model is utilized for predicting unemployment rates, and its performance is measured.

Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for unemployment rate prediction, and the model's effectiveness is evaluated.

# How to Use
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/unemployment-analysis.git
Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment.
Run each cell sequentially to observe the step-by-step analysis and predictions.



Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different models, or customize the analysis based on your specific interests or dataset.
